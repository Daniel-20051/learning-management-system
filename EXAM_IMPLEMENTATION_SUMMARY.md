## üîÑ Data Flow

### Grading Flow:
1. Admin navigates to exam details page
2. Clicks "Student Attempts" tab
3. System loads all submitted attempts via `GetExamAttempts(examId, "submitted")`
4. Admin clicks "Grade" button on an attempt
5. GradingDialog opens and loads attempt details via `GetAttemptForGrading(attemptId)`
6. Admin enters scores and feedback for theory questions
7. Clicks "Save Grades" button
8. System calls `BulkGradeTheoryAnswers(attemptId, grades)`
9. Dialog closes and attempts list refreshes

### Statistics Flow:
1. Admin clicks "Statistics" tab
2. System calls `GetExamStatistics(examId)`
3. Displays comprehensive statistics in card grid

### Question Bank Flow:
1. Admin creates/edits exam
2. Selects exam type and selection mode
3. If selection mode is "manual", opens QuestionBankDialog
4. Dialog loads questions via `GetBankQuestions(courseId, questionType)`
5. Admin selects questions
6. Selected questions are added to exam

## üìã Updated Exam Configuration

The exam creation/editing now supports:

### Exam Type Options:
- `"objective-only"`: Only objective questions (Multiple Choice, True/False)
- `"theory-only"`: Only theory questions (Essay, Short Answer)
- `"mixed"`: Both objective and theory questions

### Selection Mode Options:
- `"manual"`: Pre-select specific questions from the bank
- `"random"`: Auto-select random questions from the bank

### Randomize Option:
- Boolean flag to randomize question order per student

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Grade Student Exam
```typescript
// Load attempts for an exam
const attempts = await api.GetExamAttempts(examId, "submitted");

// Load specific attempt for grading
const attemptDetails = await api.GetAttemptForGrading(attemptId);

// Grade theory answers
await api.BulkGradeTheoryAnswers(attemptId, [
  { answer_id: 1, score: 8, feedback: "Excellent answer!" },
  { answer_id: 2, score: 6, feedback: "Good, but needs more detail" }
]);
```

### Example 2: Get Exam Statistics
```typescript
const stats = await api.GetExamStatistics(examId);
console.log(`Average Score: ${stats.average_score}%`);
console.log(`Pass Rate: ${stats.pass_rate}%`);
```

### Example 3: Load Question Bank
```typescript
// Get all questions for a course
const allQuestions = await api.GetBankQuestions(courseId);

// Get only objective questions, limit to 20
const objectiveQuestions = await api.GetBankQuestions(courseId, "objective", 20);

// Get only theory questions
const theoryQuestions = await api.GetBankQuestions(courseId, "theory");
```
